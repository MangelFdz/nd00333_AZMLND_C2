# Operationalizing Machine Learning with Microsoft Azure

We will use Azure to operationalize a machine learning model with Azure Machine Learning + Python SDK. The main goals are the following:
- train a ML model in Azure ML (using AutoML),
- deploy the model (with Azure Container Instances, ACI),
- cosume the model (through REST endpoints)

A detailed list of steps consist of the following:
- Authentication
- Automated ML Experiment
- Deploy the best model
- Enable logging
- Swagger Documentation
- Consume model endpoints
- Create and publish a pipeline
- Documentation


## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model".

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
